On Sunday morning I was at my computer, surfing the web and doing some programming. I kept an eye on
Twitter, noticing that [Dave Gorman](http://twitter.com/DaveGorman) was tweeting about the radio
show he was broadcasting at the time (Absolute Radio). The theme of his show was people's odd
routines & rituals; things they do all the time, without questioning. People were texting, emailing
and tweeting in saying things like they always put their left sock on before their right, or that
they always eat food in a particular order (crisps: large to small; skittles: yellow first; etc.),
when they changed the volume on the TV it would have to be even or a multiple of 5, and other things
like that. I sent Dave [a tweet]((http://twitter.com/Ben_Nuttall/status/9424927426))
saying **I don't have lucky numbers, but criticise people whose lucky numbers are non-prime...**
thinking little of it at the time. A couple of hours later I
happened to check my ReTweets (my tweets, retweeted by others) and noticed that several people had
retweeted this tweet, none of whom I recognised until I noticed that among the retweeters was none
other than Dave Gorman himself, meaning that he must have seen it in his mentions, liked it and
retweeted it, then several of his followers must have seen it and retweeted it themselves.  
  
By the time I had seen this it was towards the end of the show so I waited for the show to be made
available as a downloadable podcast (similar to iPlayer, etc; watching shows after they were
broadcast). I downloaded and listened to it when I got home last night, listening out for my tweet
to be read out. Unless I missed it, I don't think Dave actually read it out on air, but at one point
one of the co-presenters performed a song about the things people had sent in - and he mentioned it!
That part went like this:

> I'm normal you know. I'm normal you know.
> I sort out my sweets in an orderly row
> In case I end up with too many yellows.
> I'm perfectly normal, aren't I?
> I'm perfectly normal. I'm perfectly normal.
> I have to read an old book at bath time.
> I don't have a lucky number but if I did it would be prime.
> I'm perfectly normal, aren't I?

The podcast can be downloaded from [Absolute
Radio](http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/djs_shows/shows/dave_gorman/listen_again.html)Â (21 February).  
  
Now allow me to explain my prime number thing. I don't have any numbers I would consider my 'lucky
numbers', partly because I rarely find myself in a situation where I need to pick numbers in such a
way, but mostly because I know there's no such thing as luck and cannot stand people's attitude to
sticking to their 'lucky numbers', especially when it comes to things like the Lottery (I hate the
Lottery and despise people who play it thinking they have a reasonable chance of winning, but I
think I'll save that for another blog post). Being a mathematician, the only method I would use to
pick numbers where there was no indication of any difference to be seen between them at the point of
selection would be to select *mathematically interesting* numbers. Usually number selection of the
nature to which I am referring is between 1 and 10, sometimes 1 and 20, 30 ... 50 or around that
area, so you're looking at relatively small numbers (note that seriously interesting numbers are
numbers like [33 550 336](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number), [9 814 072
356](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9814072356_(number))...) so the even numbers have little appeal as
they're common and have many factors or are factors of other regular numbers, which pushes me to go
for the primes. Having said that, 6 is a wonderfully interesting number as it is the smallest
perfect number (the sum of its factors 1, 2 and 3 is 6), and 2 is the only even prime.  
  
Recently I was contacted by an organisation called ITV Fixers, which is a project to give 16-25 year
olds the chance to do something to help others in their area of interest or something they are
passionate about. We arranged for the Manchester parkour group to take part in this to launch a
project to promote our view of parkour and show people what we do. They filmed us doing some
training last week and we shot some interviews, and the week before, Paul & I attended the exclusive
launch event (ITV Fixers has been running down South for some time and is just launching in the
Northern areas now) where I was introduced to the regional news reporter Tony Morris who asked me to
speak about the project during the official launch.
  
**EDIT:** Something I forgot to mention; Dave Gorman has to be commended for his commitment to
replying to people on Twitter. He makes such an effort to reply to people who mention him in tweets,
which is a great thing for him to do. If you remember reading on this very blog almost a year ago, I
posted explaining what had led me to start using Twitter ([Tweet
Tweet](http://www.bennuttall.com/blog/2009/04/tweet-tweet.html)); it was due to a blog post of
Dave's in which he explained the one-way system of connection (as opposed to becoming someone's
friend on Facebook, Twitter lets you follow someone to see their tweets without them having to see
yours, only whose they decide to follow). He explained then that he always tried to reply to people
who sent him tweets, which made up for him not following people back, and still meant that he could
use the service the way he wanted (i.e. following only people he wanted to.  
  
I happened to mention Dave in a tweet a couple of weeks ago ('Googlewhack' was trending at the
time), without demanding or expecting a reply, but one came. I replied back and so did he again. The
next day something else came up and he replied again. This was actually the day before I saw him do
standup at Sheffield City Hall, and that night I mentioned him in a tweet saying the show was great
and I'd really enjoyed it - he sent one out thanking everyone who'd tweeted about the show, that he
was glad they enjoyed it. Then this week he retweeted my prime numbers thing during the radio show,
and after I posted a link to this blog post (mentioning him) he replied saying:

> [@Ben_Nuttall](http://twitter.com/Ben_Nuttall) [Just so you know... it definitely was read out on
> air. Sometimes a link doesn't get into the podcast for tech
> reasons.](http://twitter.com/DaveGorman/status/9692153213)

He's actually followed the link and read the blog post and replied to me to assure me that he had
read it out on air! How brilliant is this guy!? As I said, Dave has to be commended for his
commitment to replying to people.
