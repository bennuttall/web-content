Manchester recently held the first ever Raspberry Pi conference – Raspberry Jamboree, held at
Manchester Central. It's been a year since the launch of the Pi, and this event was to review what
we did in the last year, and look forward to what we're going to do this year and in the future.

The day kicked off at 10.30 with an opening talk from organiser [Alan
O'Donahoe](http://twitter.com/teknoteacher), followed by a wonderful keynote from [BBC
Micro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) pioneer [Steve
Furber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber). The first session of talks featured [Andrew
Robinson](https://twitter.com/fortyfourmu) (creator of
[PiFace](http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm)), [Carrie Anne
Philbin](https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin) (from [Geek Gurl
Diaries](http://www.geekgurldiaries.co.uk/)) and [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/)'s [William
Bell](http://wbell.web.cern.ch/wbell/) (talking about [MagPi](http://www.themagpi.com/)). Meanwhile,
in another conference track, a hands-on workshop was being led by [Mike
Hewitson](https://twitter.com/mikeAhewitson) ([LateRooms](http://www.laterooms.com/)) and [Pete
Lomas](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/pete-lomas) ([Raspberry Pi
Foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)).

Up next was a panel discussion with Raspberry Jam organisers and attendees – including [Lisa
Mather](https://twitter.com/elsie_m_), [Dawn Hewitson](https://twitter.com/DawnHewitson), [Ben
Smith](https://twitter.com/ManchesterBudo), [Jack Wearden](https://twitter.com/JackWeirdy) and
myself. We introduced ourselves and discussed what Jams are, how they work and what we think about
them, and answered questions from the audience:

One of the things that came out of this was when asked where teachers and Jam organisers could get
material from to teach coding or run activities, the panel suggested using existing online resources
like [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and asking for help on Twitter, and I said that
between the community we should strive to make resources available for this kind of use. I suggested
anyone interested get together with me to discuss creating a central repository for programming
tools and exercises for the classroom, code clubs or for personal skills development – using GitHub
as an example platform for how this could feasibly happen and have contributions of new projects and
improvements of existing ones, and making it easy for teachers to download and use. Since the
Jamboree I've been in talks with a few people regarding this. All I can say right now is watch this
space – or, better – email me your thoughts if you're interested.

After lunch I got to see Raspberry Pi Foundation evangelist [Rob
Bishop](https://twitter.com/rob_bishop) speak about what's going on with them, which was fantastic.
He's a wonderful enthusiastic speaker and I really felt the energy of what this is all for. I got a
bit carried away with this tweet:

> Omg @[rob_bishop](https://twitter.com/rob_bishop) is an epic evangelical
> @[raspberry_pi](https://twitter.com/raspberry_pi) speaker. He emits pure enthusiasm and
> inspiration. I could do with more of this.

Next up was [Paul Hallet](https://twitter.com/phalt_), whose project
[DjangoPi](http://djangopi.com/) had caught my attention when it was announced last year. That's one
of the great thing about the Jamboree – we'd all heard of all these names but never met most of
them, so it was amazing to have everyone all together in one room where you could put names to
faces, shake a few hands and pat people on the back! Paul's talk was on crowdsource funding for
projects, and he went over the story of his projects such as DjangoPi and the coding club he ran in
a local school. Great going for an undergraduate student! He already has a [fantastic
CV](http://phalt.co/ph_cv.pdf)!

Following Rob and Paul was one of the [Manchester Raspberry Jam](http://mcrraspjam.org.uk/) regulars
– a 13 year old who goes by the alias 'Mini Girl Geek'. [Amy
Mather](https://twitter.com/minigirlgeek) was asked to present a project she and I started at a Jam
in December – Conway's Game of Life. What began as a simple Python programming exercise turned in to
a really interesting project involving pygame, Raspberry Pi, Arduino and an LED matrix display!
Amy's talk was extremely well received, she was praised by all and congratulated personally by the
likes of [Paul Beech](https://twitter.com/guru), Rob Bishop and Pete Lomas! As one of the adults who
has guided her along the way, I'm very proud of her for giving this talk and can say she did so
professionally – a thoroughly enjoyable talk. Now watch it!

It's since been featured on the [Raspberry Pi blog](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3506) and in
the [Pycoders Weekly
newsletter](http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/?u=9735795484d2e4c204da82a29&id=8d2a169bdd)!

A closing address from Alan rounded things up and a few of us headed to the nearby Pizza Express.
After a mishap with their machine not accepting my (perfectly valid) card, Alan pulled a few strings
and persuaded them to accept slightly less cash than than the value of the meal, we hastily moved
on. Most of the group headed home but a few of us stayed out and proceeded to
[Brewdog](http://www.brewdog.com/bars/manchester) where we later met up with Rob, Paul, Carrie Anne,
[Simon](https://twitter.com/cymplecy) and Andrew and the others. We had a great night getting better
acquainted with each other – as I said, many of us knew each other by online personalities only so
it was interesting to speak in person for a change. We also dished out a few dozen Raspberry Pi
coasters around the bar. I had a fantastic day and really enjoyed socialising in the evening. I
tweeted this the following morning:

> Been up for a couple of hours already. Woke up really early this morning, not sure if it's the
> hangover or just the buzz from [#RJamboree](https://twitter.com/search/%23RJamboree)
