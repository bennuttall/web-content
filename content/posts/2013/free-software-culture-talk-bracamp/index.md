Last month I attended the Manchester Girl Geeks Barcamp – affectionately known as *bracamp*. I did a
talk on *Free Software Culture*, covering the varying definitions of "free" (libre/gratis), the
principles of free and open source, why people do it, how development is managed and demonstrated
use cases, as well as battle some gripes from a misunderstood audience member – which really helped
me get my point across better.

I started the talk quite poorly but got more steady as it got going. It's not filmed from the best
angle (limited options) and there's some background noise at times but it's generally ok.
