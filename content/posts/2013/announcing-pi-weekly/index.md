Two weeks ago I had an idea – to launch a weekly Raspberry Pi email newsletter. I had a think about
how it would work and what it would entail. I subscribe to a handful of similar ones for programming
topics, notably a Python one called [PyCoders Weekly](http://pycoders.com/), which is a simple link
aggregator with short descriptions, for news and projects.

I pinged [Ryan](http://twitter.com/ryanteck), a person I've never met but know through the Pi
community on Twitter, to see if he liked the idea, and if he wanted to get in on it. He ponged in
agreement and was on board. We discussed ideas for names and decided on *Pi Weekly* – the next day I
registered the domain [piweekly.net](http://piweekly.net) and registered the Twitter account
[@pi_weekly](http://twitter.com/pi_weekly) (unfortunately @piweekly is taken by *Personal Injury
Weekly*). Then I set up a WordPress site and a mailchimp account, wrote a quick clean
[theme](http://github.com/bennuttall/piweekly) for the site, added some information and stuck the
signup box on the homepage. Ryan and I had a look around for some links to put in the newsletter,
shared ideas about how we should lay it out and we decided we were ready to launch that week.

I told a handful of friends about it, and we had 13 people signed up by the time we announced it on
Twitter. Word spread quickly and we were tweeted about by Liz Upton on the [Raspberry Pi
Foundation](http://twitter.com/raspberry_pi) Twitter account:

> Big thanks to [@ben_nuttall](https://twitter.com/ben_nuttall) and
> [@ryanteck](https://twitter.com/ryanteck) for all their work on
> [@pi_weekly](https://twitter.com/pi_weekly) – superb idea! We've added it to our weekly reading
> list.

An hour and a half after the noon launch, we had 100 subscribers. By the end of the weekend we'd
passed 300.

The newsletter will contain Raspberry Pi community news, interesting projects we've found, github
projects, blog articles, how-to guides, cool products and whatever else we find that's worth
sharing! It'll be quite concise digest of carefully selected links with short descriptions.

All past issues will be readable on the [archive](http://piweekly.net/archive) page Check out
[Issue #1](http://piweekly.net/seed/). If you have any suggestions for links for us to include, you can
tweet them to [@pi_weekly](http://twitter.com/pi_weekly) or email <submissions@piweekly.net> – sign
up at [piweekly.net](http://piweekly.net/)

EDIT: In August 2013, Pi Weekly was featured on the Raspberry Pi website and we were praised and
highly recommended by Liz Upton. Read the post – [Pi Weekly: a free email
