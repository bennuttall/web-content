I've now completed my second full year working as software engineer in the [News
Labs](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/) team at the BBC. Another year working from home; the team
officially moved into [BBC R&D](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd); and I was promoted to senior engineer.

In 2021 I worked on:

- [**mosromgr**](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/mosromgr/), a Python library for managing TV and
  radio running orders, which this year we [open sourced](https://github.com/bbc/mosromgr) and we're
  currently working on rolling out to teams around the BBC to make use of
- **[Semi-automated chapter points for the Radio 4 Today
  programme](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/news/2021/slicer-today-trial/),** which went
  [live](https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1405910025961459715) as a month-long trial
- [**MODUS**](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/modus/), an experiment in using machine-summarised
  articles for new formats such as the bullet-point list in the public beta of the BBC News app,
  currently being trialled for red button services
- **BBC Images**, a new image search tool for journalists based on the Guardian's open source
  [GRID](https://github.com/guardian/grid/) platform
- [**Oriel**](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/oriel/), an image collections curation tool based
  on BBC Images with a metadata enrichment pipeline
- **IDX**, a prototype tool for marking important segments of live TV and radio programmes for
  re-use to make them accessible to personalisation services and more
