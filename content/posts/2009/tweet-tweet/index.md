I'm now on Twitter. If you're one of the people who have heard of Twitter and you're terrified that
it will be the new Facebook which is the new MySpace, then please calm down, this is not the case.
No-one is going to leave Facebook to join Twiter, they are not the same thing. Facebook has
statuses, photos, videos, applications, comments, wallposts, private messages, groups, pages and all
the rest, and I think it's safe to say it's here to stay.

Twitter, however, is only about status
updates. Now before you dismiss it as pointless saying "but Facebook already does that", reseat
yourself and allow me to explain. The main thing about the conceot of being on Twiter is that it's
purely one-way. Facebook is two-way; if you want to connect with someone you request to become their
friend and if and only if they recipricate, the connection is formed. On Twitter, you choose to
'follow' people, which means their updates appear in your feeds when you log in, but they don't have
to accept you and in turn receive your updates. For example if I want to receive Stephen Fry's
updates, why would he want to receive mine, along with the thousands of other people following him?

It was this concept that led to me signing up. It was a post on Dave Gorman's blog about how a
couple of people had sent him messages saying he was rude not to follow them, when they had followed
him. He explained to them that it would be pointless for him to follow the thousands of people
following him, as it would be impossible to take in so much information and he wouldn't be able to
actually keep track on the people he specifically wanted to. These people were seriously offended by
this and said that he should be polite, even if he wasn't going to actually read the updates. So
apparently they would prefer it if he admitted that he was never going to read their updates, just
so they could add one to their number of followers, like the MySpace culture. In my opinion, MySpace
has its place - mainly for musicians, groups, bands, singers, DJs and such. It was only being used
by people because Facebook wasn't here yet.

MySpace isn't for me, but Facebook and Twitter are.
Facebook is for almost everyone. Twitter isn't for everyone, because a lot of people don't have
anything interesting to post. I hate those statuses on Facebook: "...is having a pizza", "...is
bored", "...is popping in the shower" - WHY BOTHER!?

However, there are genuinely interesting and/or
witty people out there who are on Twitter. Whether I am interesting and/or witty is up to you and it
is your decision whether to follow me or not. One of the things I like is that I can have my updates
shown in the sidebar of this website, so it's not just my Twitter followers that will see them, but
my website and blog readers. These are some of the [people I'm

I watched a TV Quiz show hosted by Chris Moyles the other night because Stephen Fry was one of the
guests. I'd seen on his Twitter a few days before that he would be appearing, and he had asked his
followers what sort of quiz it was, and his worries of being useless in the quiz due to being away
travelling the world filming a documentary were confirmed by people's replies and he posted saying
it was about recent popular culture, and he replied saying:

> "...Oh dear I've been away for months & don't read newspapers. I'm dead"

Then during the show, when it was his turn to take the main chair and do the quiz, Chris called him
over (I'm paraphrasing):  

> **Chris M**: *Up next, Stephen ... Stephen! ... Stephen!! STEPHEN! What are you doing? Are you on
> Twitter!?*  
> **Stephen F**: *Yes, sorry...*

And then he put down his mobile phone and joined Chris at the front. At one point Chris asked him
who would win between him and Stephen Hawking at a 'clever-off', which Fry humbly said Hawking was
cleverer than he.

Speaking of Hawking - today I happened upon the *Telegraph*'s [Top 100 Living
Geniuses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1567544/Top-100-living-geniuses.html) in which I
was surprised to see they've listed Matt Groening (creator of *The Simpsons* and *Futurama*) higher
than Stephen Hawking. Not sure how that happened, but there are some other odd choices in the list
too. I have to say that [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) deserves the
top spot (maybe equal with [Larry Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page) & [Sergey
Brin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin) (founders of Google)). I'm not sure why Osama Bin
Laden is in there. And I think J.K. Rowling ought to be higher as she probably inspired millions of
kids to start reading. This table was made up of a survey of 4,000 Britons and based on the
following criteria: paradigm shifting; popular acclaim; intellectual power; achievement and cultural
importance.
