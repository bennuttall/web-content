This is the new parkour documentary. It was produced by two good friends of mine; the
legendary [Paul Maunder](http://obsidianpkav.blogspot.com/) and written by the Chairman of
the [British Parkour Coaching Association](http://www.britishparkour.org/), [Dave
Sedgley](http://www.britishparkour.org.uk/index.php?name=Content_3&pid=1). This is truly the
greatest parkour documentary we have seen to date, in terms of its content (the words and the
movement) and in terms of how well it was produced, putting the word of parkour out there in such a
way to put the name of parkour in its proper place. It's the best thing we've ever seen in parkour.

As stated at the start of the film, its purpose is to introduce people to parkour and to correct any
misconceptions the viewer may have from past explanations or natural assumptions about what parkour
is based on what they may have seen.

It's in four parts and well worth taking the time to sit down, turn off any distractions and just
watch and learn.
