Back in February at the Raspberry Jamboree, my colleagues [Carrie
Anne](http://twitter.com/missphilbin), [Clive](http://twitter.com/clivebeale) and I were interviewed
by the Linux Voice team about [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org)'s views on computing
education.

Linux Voice is a fantastic new free software magazine which was funded by a crowdfunding campaign
on Indiegogo at the end of last year. I backed it as soon as I heard about it, and I eagerly
anticipated the arrival of its first issue. We're now five issues in and I've loved every one – the
guys are doing a great job. I highly recommend a [subscription](http://shop.linuxvoice.com/)!

From the beginning they committed to making all their articles available for free after up to nine
months from publishing, released with a [Creative Commons licence](http://creativecommons.org/).
Some material has been published early, such as the brilliant [piece on Grace
Hopper](http://www.linuxvoice.com/history-of-computing-part-2/) from Issue 3. Luckily for us, the
interview they conducted with us, which featured in Issue 2, was released in full earlier this
month, so I'm pleased to be able to share it now!
