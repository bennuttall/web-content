This is just a video I made up of some clips from training yesterday morning on Rother Valley. I was
just on this little playground doing some precisions and stuff, and using the bars and that sort of
thing, and decided to test the camera out. I haven't used video editing software before, so this is
new to me. This is purely a pilot vid for practise. I know it's a little repetitive and that, but,
as I said, it's just a test really. Glad to see it all works alright, apart from randomly being
central and my navigation links are nowhere to be found (which has now been resolved). If anyone has
any tips with using Windows Movie Maker (don't just tell me to use a Mac, Paul! lol) as I'm new to
it all and have only discovered the basic features. Thanks for watching. Bear this paragraph in mind
before leaving any comments. Thanks. More to come soon!

The bit at the end needs explaining really, I had my phone playing music, with the earphones going up my
shirt from my pocket. as I was losing my balance on the rail, and crouching down, the phone fell out
without me noticing at first, but just hung from the wire, when the headphones got jerked out of my
ear i looked round, lost my balance and fell forward, the wire got caught over the bar I was stood
on, and my weight caused the phone to flip off the other side lol all the pieces flying out in the
process. I went round to pick them up lol. I forgot to mention this, it's not easy to tell...
