I just signed up to the Organ Donors List. Now, if I die, the UK Transplants Organisation have
permission to use all my organs and tissue. Isn't it great!?

It's something I've always wanted to make sure I was on the list and all that, but as is always the
case, I never got round to it. This mornining I discovered a leaflet with a form you send off, and
after I filled it in I noticed you can register online, so did that instead.

Got my Mom to do it too, and I'll get the rest of the family on it when they get home tonight. Woo.

Please do consider signing up, readers, it's so worthwhile! It takes less than a minute. I hope you
take me up on this one.

Holla if you have any problems signing up.

EDIT: I also signed up to donate blood, so I'm going to the session in Killamarsh on November 5th.
