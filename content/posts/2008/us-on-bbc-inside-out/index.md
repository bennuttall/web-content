It all started with an email fromÂ [Jamie
Coulson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/content/articles/2007/08/14/jamie_coulson_feature.shtml). He
asked if I could set something up to film parkour for his programme, Inside Out, for the BBC. I told
him about the (then upcoming) Trace Gathering and he was very interested, so I arranged with Jason
Matten, the organiser, and arranged for Jamie and a cameraman to come along for one day of the
event.

We met him at Grindleford station and walked up to Padley Gorge where he filmed a warm-up led by
Jason, and as the day went on the two BBC guys followed the groups around the peaks and filmed bits
here and there.

A couple of weeks later we arranged a filming session in Sheffield City Centre to capture parkour in
the urban environment as well as rural. We did some stuff around the Crucible and Hallam University
mainly. They also filmed some interviews on both filming days which were an integral part of the
programme. Dave Sedgley talked about working towards parkour being taught safely by qualified
coaches, Daniel Ilabaca talked about what he understands parkour to be about, and there were other
good talks from Blake (Saiyans) and Jason Matten.

The video, as was shown on BBC One Yorkshire & Lincolnshire, can be seen on the YouTube:

Here's Paul's Trace Gathering video, he's only just got round to editing it but it's well worth the
wait:
