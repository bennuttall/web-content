I now have a monthly column on opensource.com – a brilliant website for all things open source. I'll
be writing articles about Raspberry Pi – particularly its use in education.

My first piece was published last week, covering the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/) competition –
we're sending two Raspberry Pis to the International Space Station! Read the full piece:
[*Students compete for a chance to have their Raspberry Pi code run in
space*](http://opensource.com/education/15/4/uk-students-compete-chance-have-their-raspberry-pi-code-run-space).

This piece was featured in the website's weekly [top
5](http://opensource.com/life/15/4/weekly-top-5-april-10):
