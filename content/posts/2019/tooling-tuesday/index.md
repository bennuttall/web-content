I've decided to take a leaf out of [Les](https://twitter.com/biglesp)'s book and post about a new
tool every Tuesday!

From now on I'll be sharing short weekly posts introducing a tool I've enjoyed using â€“ mostly
software stuff usually related to open source, Python, Linux, Raspberry Pi and so on.

I've set up a new blog especially, as my main blog is generally for longer articles and bigger
updates. So this can be something in between Twitter and a blog :)

Look out for more of my content:

- [on my blog](/)
- [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ben_nuttall)
- [on opensource.com](https://opensource.com/users/bennuttall)
- [on raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/author/bennuttall/)

I'll post my first tooling tuesday post on 16 April 2019.
