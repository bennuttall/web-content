The [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) wrote about Hack To The Future on their [Research &
Development](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/) blog, including a short video
featuring their coverage of me explaining my [nontransitive
dice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_dice) session! Also some screen time with
[Sam](http://mightaswell.co.uk/) of [Manchester Girl Geeks](http://manchester.girlgeekdinners.com/)
(who gave a brilliant keynote); [Tom Crick](http://twitter.com/DrTomCrick) (Cardiff Metropolitan
University); and of course, organiser [Alan O'Donahoe](http://twitter.com/teknoteacher).

I had a great time at the event, got to witness a real sensation of excitement for computer science
amongst children. It's really encouraging that we're finally harnessing that energy and hopefully
will be able to give direction to the kids interested in taking up programming.
