Earlier this month, I spoke on the Python track at FOSDEM 2017. My talk introduced the Raspberry Pi
as a tool for physical computing and IoT to Python programmers in the free & open-source software
community.

I talked about the Raspberry Pi Foundation's mission, our education programmes, introduced the GPIO
pinout, HATs, GPIO Zero, Remote GPIO, Picamera, Energenie, Sense HAT, Astro Pi and more. You can
