I have attended and spoken at the EuroPython conference for the last few years, and this time I
focused on physical computing with Python and Raspberry Pi, including GPIO Zero, Picamera and the

[speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/bennuttall/physical-computing-with-python-and-raspberry-pi-europython-2017)
and you can watch the video here:
