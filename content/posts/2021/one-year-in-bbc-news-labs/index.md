I've now completed a full year working as software engineer in the [News
Labs](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/) team at the BBC. It's been an odd year, obviously, but we've been
cracking on with all kinds of projects – finding new ways to help journalists do their jobs;
innovating around user experiences in news products and experimenting with other new ideas.

So far, I've worked on:

- **Personalised AV research** – investigating various ways we could deliver personalised content to
  people
- **[Digital Paper Edit](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/digital-paper-edit/)** – a web app
  allowing journalists to rough-cut edit audio and video files by editing an automated transcript
- **MOS Running Order Manager** – a Python library and suite of AWS services for managing
  [MOS](http://mosprotocol.com/) running orders and extracting information about stories within TV
  and radio programmes
- **Personalised Skippy** – a hack project re-using news clips from
  [Skippy](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/voice-user-interfaces/) (the BBC News Alexa
  integration project) for a non-interactive personalised audio news experience
- **Personalised AV prototype** – a web app displaying a personalised selection of segments from TV
  programmes
- **[Live Segment Notifications](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/live-segment-notifications/)** –
  proof-of-concept for notifying users of relevant upcoming stories within TV and radio programmes
  in real-time, generated from running order data
- **Wiley Heatman** – a hack project allowing users to add reactions and comments to specific blocks
  within pieces of modular content
- **[MODUS](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/modus/)** – a project to help journalists create
  article formats that appeal to different audience groups from the same block of text
