I was sad to hear the [news of the death of Ronnie Corbett](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35934024).
I've always been a huge fan of *The Two Ronnies* and much of the other work the duo had done both
together and individually.

Within moments of the news breaking, tributes such as photographs of four candles and fork handles,

[created the repo](https://github.com/bennuttall/handles/), and encouraged others to fork it:
