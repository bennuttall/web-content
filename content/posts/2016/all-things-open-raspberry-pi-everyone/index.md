I recently attended [*All Things Open*](https://allthingsopen.org/), an open-source conference in
Raleigh, North Carolina, run by Red Hat. I was invited by my friends at
[opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) – and it was a great opportunity to meet the team and some
of the moderators, columnists and contributors.

I was asked to give a lightning talk, and I decided to speak about the Raspberry Pi Foundation's
mission: what we do, how we do it, and where we're at now! Here's the video of the talk (3m20s):

My slides are published on
[speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/bennuttall/raspberry-pi-for-everyone). I also wrote an article
on the same subject for my column that month: [Raspberry Pi continues to blaze new
trails](https://opensource.com/life/16/11/raspberry-pi-continues-blaze-new-trails).

I also got the opportunity to visit Red Hat Towers, and meet their CEO [Jim
Whitehurst](https://twitter.com/jwhitehurst) to talk about why I contribute to opensource.com. And
for the conference social afterparty, they'd booked nerdcore artist [MC
Frontalot](https://twitter.com/mc_frontalot)!

Thanks to the All Things Open and opensource.com teams, to Red Hat, to Jim Whitehurst, and to all
the speakers at ATO!
