I was invited to give the closing keynote at [PyCon Russia](http://pycon.ru/2016/en/), which took
place in Moscow in July. It was my first visit to Russia – and I had a great trip.

I travelled with [David McIver](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver), the author of property-based testing
framework, [hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works/). I also got to spend some time with other
international speakers including [Jackie Kazil](https://twitter.com/JackieKazil) (whom I met on my
[2014 US Tour](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/bens-mega-usa-tour/)), Python core developer
[Raymond Hettinger](https://twitter.com/raymondh), Google developer [Nathaniel
Manista](https://github.com/nathanielmanistaatgoogle), and (local) [Armin
Ronacher](https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko), the creator of the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web
framework.

Here's the video of my talk on *Physical computing with Python and Raspberry Pi*. I spoke about the
Raspberry Pi, the Foundation and its mission, and lots of technical detail about the [GPIO
Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/) library:
